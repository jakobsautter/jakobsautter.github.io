                    <p>
                        Hello! My name is Jakob Sautter and I am a Senior Software Engineer based in Vienna/Berlin with 9+ years of professional
                        experience designing, developing, and implementing enterprise web-applications and software analytics solutions. I am
                        specifically interested in backend development, designing service architectures, creating APIs and working with databases.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have a strong academic background in software engineering and hold a BSc and MSc degree. Before that I studied Sociology
                        which reflects my desire to look at things from very different perspectives.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My interests span modern distributed services architecture and generative/meta programming as well as
                        technology-society-discourses and pop culture. In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with my wife, playing Nintendo games
                        from the late 90s (and lately some more current ones) and going out to dinner with my friends.
                    </p>
                    <p>You can reach out to me on my <a href="#contact">contact</a> page.</p>
